## Conflict resolution

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/conflict-resolution/mk1.jpg)

In most cases a `git merge` runs smooth and automatic.
Then a merge commit appears (unless fast-forward) without you even noticing.

Git is very good at resolving modifications when merging branches.

But sometimes the same line is modified on two branches and Git issues a conflict.
Then you need to tell Git which version to keep.

There are several ways to do that as we will see.

---

## Exercise: create a conflict

- Create two branches from `master`.
- On the two branches make **different modifications** to the amount of the **same ingredient**.

These are my modifications:

```shell
$ git show-branch

* [dislike-cilantro] please no cilantro
 ! [like-cilantro] more cilantro please
  ! [master] Merge branch 'experiment' into less-salt
---
*   [dislike-cilantro] please no cilantro
 +  [like-cilantro] more cilantro please
--- [master] Merge branch 'experiment' into less-salt
```

On the branch `like-cilantro` I have the following change:

```
diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
index 27a808c..5550d6d 100644
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@ -2,4 +2,4 @@
 * 1 lime
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 1/2 onion
-* 1 tbsp cilantro
+* 2 tbsp cilantro
```

And on the branch `dislike-cilantro` we have the following change:

```
diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
index 27a808c..10eed42 100644
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@ -2,4 +2,4 @@
 * 1 lime
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 1/2 onion
-* 1 tbsp cilantro
+* 0 tbsp cilantro
```

### What do you expect will happen when I try to merge these two?

```shell
$ git branch

* dislike-cilantro
  like-cilantro
  master

$ git merge like-cilantro

Auto-merging ingredients.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ingredients.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Without conflict Git would have automatically created a merge commit,
but since there is a conflict, Git did not commit:

```shell
$ git status

On branch dislike-cilantro
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   ingredients.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Observe how Git gives us clear instructions on how to move forward.

Let us inspect the conflicting file:

```
$ cat ingredients.txt

* 2 avocados
* 1 lime
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 onion
<<<<<<< HEAD
* 0 tbsp cilantro
=======
* 2 tbsp cilantro
>>>>>>> like-cilantro
```

Git inserted resolution markers (the `<<<<<<<`, `>>>>>>>`, and `=======`).

Try also `git diff`:

```
diff --cc ingredients.txt
index 10eed42,5550d6d..0000000
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@@ -2,4 -2,4 +2,8 @@@
  * 1 lime
  * 1 tsp salt
  * 1/2 onion
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +* 0 tbsp cilantro
++=======
+ * 2 tbsp cilantro
++>>>>>>> like-cilantro
```

`git diff` now only shows the conflicting part, nothing else.

We have to resolve the conflict.
We will discuss 3 different ways to do this.

---

## Manual resolution

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
* 0 tbsp cilantro
=======
* 2 tbsp cilantro
>>>>>>> like-cilantro
```

- Manual resolution means that you have to edit the code/text between the resolution markers.
- Git stages all files without conflicts and leaves the files with conflicts unstaged.
- Decide what you keep (the one, the other, or both or something else).
- Then remove the resolution markers.
- Tell Git that you have resolved the conflict with `git add ingredients.txt`.
- Then verify with `git status`.
- Now commit the merge; this opens up a prepared commit message that you can keep or modify.
- It is good practice to keep the information that there was a conflict in the commit message.

---

## Resolution using mergetool

```shell
$ git mergetool
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/conflict-resolution/mergetool.png)

- Your current branch is left, the branch you merge is right, result is in the middle.
- After you are done, close and commit, `git add` is not needed when using `git mergetool`.

---

## Using "ours" or "theirs" strategy

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/conflict-resolution/mk2.jpg)

- Sometimes you know that you want to keep "ours" version (version on this branch)
  or "theirs" (version on the merged branch).
- Then you do not have to resolve conflicts manually.
- See [merge strategies](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies).
- If "theirs" is things done by someone else consider how they will feel.

```shell
$ git checkout --theirs ingredients.txt  # take the version of the other branch
                                         # alternative would be --ours
$ git add ingredients.txt                # tell Git that you have resolved it
$ git commit
```

---

## Aborting a conflicting merge

- Imagine it is Friday evening, you try to merge but have conflicts all over
  the place.
- You do not feel like resolving it now and want to undo the half-finished
  merge.
- Or it is a conflict that you cannot resolve and only your colleague knows
  which version is the one to keep.
- There is no reason to panic and delete the whole repository.
- Simply reset the repository to `HEAD` (last committed state).

```shell
$ git reset --hard HEAD  # throws away everything that is not in HEAD
```

The repository looks exactly as it was before the merge.

---

## Avoiding conflicts

- Conflicts can be avoided if you think and talk with your colleagues before committing.
- Think and plan to which branch you will commit to.
- Fortran people: modifying common blocks often causes conflicts.
- Modifying global data often causes conflicts.
- Monolithic entangled spaghetti-code maximizes risk of conflicts.
- Modular programming minimizes risk of conflicts.
- Ball-of-mud branches for "everything" maximize risk of conflicts.
- One branch for one task only.
- Resolve conflicts early.
- If the branch affects code that is likely to be modified by others:
  - the branch should be short-lived and/or merge often to the main development line
  - the branch should merge the main development line often to stay up-to-date
