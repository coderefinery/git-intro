## Command line, GitHub, and VS Code

As usual, we offer ways to do this with the command line, VS Code, and
GitHub.

* **Command line** is most powerful and relatively easy with this.
  You may also use it along with other things. If you haven't tried
  it yet, we'd recommend you to give it a try.
* The **GitHub** web interface allows many things to be done, but not
  everything.
* **VS Code** allows some of these, but for some it's easier to open
  the VS Code terminal and run Git there.


## Our toolbox for history inspection

:::{instructor-note}
First the instructor demonstrates few commands on a real life example
repository <https://github.com/networkx/networkx> (mentioned in the amazing site [The
Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)).
Later we will practice these in an archaeology exercise (below).
:::


### Warm-up: ["Git History" browser](https://githistory.xyz/)

As a warm-up we can try the ["Git History" browser](https://githistory.xyz/)
on the README.rst file of the [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) repository:

- Visit and browse <https://github.githistory.xyz/networkx/networkx/blob/main/README.rst> (use left/right keys).
- You can try this on some of your GitHub repositories, too!


### Searching text patterns in the repository

With `git grep` you can find all lines in a repository which contain some string or regular expression.
This is useful to find out where in the code some variable is used or
some error message printed.

:::::{tabs}
  ::::{group-tab} Command line
    The Git command is as described above:
    ```console
    $ git grep TEXT
    $ git grep "some text with spaces"
    ```

    In the [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) repository you can try:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/networkx/networkx
    $ cd networkx
    $ git grep -i fixme
    ```

    While `git grep` searches the **current state** of the repository,
    it is also possible to search through all changes with `git log -S sometext`
    which can be useful to find where something got removed.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} GitHub
    We can try the same example in the browser:
    <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anetworkx%2Fnetworkx%20fixme&type=code>

    ```{figure} img/archaeology/search.png
       :alt: Searching for "fixme" in a GitHub repository
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Searching for "fixme" in a GitHub repository.
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} VS Code
    Our example repository is <https://github.com/networkx/networkx>.
    From a new VS Code window, select "Clone Git repository" and enter
    that URL.

	Searching with the magnifying glass from the left sidebar is
	equivalent to `git grep`.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} RStudio
  Edit → Find in files.

  Use the command line method for more power.

### Inspecting individual commits

:::::{tabs}
  ::::{group-tab} Command line
    We have seen this one before already. Using `git show` we can inspect an individual commit if
    we know its hash:

    ```console
    $ git show HASH
    ```

    For instance:
    ```console
    $ git show 759d589bdfa61aff99e0535938f14f67b01c83f7
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} GitHub
    We can try the same example in the browser:
    <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/759d589bdfa61aff99e0535938f14f67b01c83f7>

    ```{figure} img/archaeology/show.png
       :alt: Inspecting an individual commit on GitHub
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Inspecting an individual commit on GitHub.
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} VS Code
    We don't know of a built-in way to see every single Git commit in
    order (extensions allow this).  You can open the terminal and run
    the command line option.

	But, if you open single files, a "Timeline" view under the
    explorer shows changes to *that file*.  You can click on a change
	to see the details.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} RStudio
  The graph view lets you select certain commits for viewing.  The search box lets you search for a certain commit by hash.

  :::{figure} img/commits/rstudio-graph-view.png

  :::

### Line-by-line code annotation with metadata

With `git annotate` you can see line by line who and **when** the line was
modified last. It also prints the precise hash of the last change which
modified each line. Incredibly useful for reproducibility.

:::::{tabs}
  ::::{group-tab} Command line
    ```console
    $ git annotate FILE
    ```

    Example:
    ```console
    $ git annotate networkx/convert_matrix.py
    ```

    If you annotate in a terminal and the file is longer than the screen, Git by default uses the program `less` to
    scroll the output.
    Use `/sometext` `<ENTER>` to find "sometext" and you can cycle through the results with `n` (next) and `N` (last).
    You can also use page up/down to scroll. You can quit with `q`.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} GitHub
    We can try the same example in the browser:
    <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blame/main/networkx/convert_matrix.py>

    ```{figure} img/archaeology/annotate.png
       :alt: Screenshot of file annotation on GitHub
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Screenshot of file annotation on GitHub.
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} VS Code
    It seems this needs an extension.  We'd recommend trying the
    command line method for now.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} RStudio
  Use the command line method (from what we can tell).
  ::::

:::::

:::{discussion} Discuss how these relatively trivial changes affect the annotation
- Wrapping long lines of text/code into shorter lines
- Auto-formatting tools such as `black`
- Editors that automatically remove trailing whitespace
:::


### Inspecting code in the past

:::::{tabs}
  ::::{group-tab} Command line
    We can create branches pointing to a commit in the past.
    This is the recommended mechanism to inspect old code:

    ```console
    $ git switch --create BRANCHNAME HASH
    ```

    Example (lines starting with "#" are only comments):

    ```bash
    # create branch called "older-code" from hash 347e6292419b
    $ git switch --create older-code 347e6292419bd0e4bff077fe971f983932d7a0e9

    # now you can navigate and inspect the code as it was back then
    # ...

    # after we are done we can switch back to "main"
    $ git switch main

    # if we like we can delete the "older-code" branch
    $ git branch -d older-code
    ```

    On old Git versions which do not know the `switch` command (before 2.23), you
    need to use this instead:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b BRANCHNAME SOMEHASH
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} GitHub
    We now know how to visit a specific commit:
    <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/347e629>

    Once we are there we can "Browse files" at that point in history.

    ```{figure} img/archaeology/browse-files.png
       :alt: Browsing code in the past on GitHub
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Browsing code in the past on GitHub.
    ```
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} VS Code
    Switch to "Source Control", then the "..." menu, then "Branch", then "Create new branch from..." and now you can type a commit identifier (hash).

    Make sure you change back to the main branch when you are done.
  ::::

  ::::{group-tab} RStudio
  It seems you can only create branches from the present (at least without extensions). Use the command line method.
  ::::

## Exercise

:::::::{exercise} Exercise: Explore basic archaeology commands (20 min)
  Let us explore the value of these commands in an exercise.  Future
  exercises do not depend on this, so it is OK if you do not complete
  it fully.

  Exercise steps:
  - **Make sure you are not inside another Git repository** when running this
    exercise. If you are, first step "outside" of it.
    We want to avoid creating a Git repository inside another Git repository.
    :::::{tabs}
      ::::{group-tab} Command line
        You can check if you are inside a Git repository with:
        ```console
        $ git status

        fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
        ```
        You want to see the above message which tells us that this is not a Git repository.
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} GitHub
        This is not a problem in the GitHub web interface since we are not
        creating a new local repository.
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} VS Code
        **Warning: many of these exercise tasks aren't possible in the VS Code interface without extensions.  You can use VS Code to clone the project, but be prepared to start the terminal to do the main tasks.**

        "File" → "New Window".
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} RStudio
        **Warning: many of these exercise tasks aren't possible in the RStudio interface.  You can use RStudio to clone the project, but be prepared to start the terminal to do the main tasks.**

        File → New Project.
      ::::

    :::::

  - Clone this repository:
    <https://github.com/networkx/networkx.git>.
    :::::{tabs}
      ::::{group-tab} Command line
        ```console
        $ git clone https://github.com/networkx/networkx.git
        ```
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} GitHub
        Nothing to clone. We will try to inspect the repository directly on GitHub.
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} VS Code
        From a new VS Code window, select "Clone Git repository" and enter
        that URL.
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} RStudio
      From the new project window, choose Version Control → Git → and enter the URL
      ::::

    :::::

  - Then let us all **make sure we are working on a well-defined version** of the repository.
    :::::{tabs}
      ::::{group-tab} Command line
        Step into the new directory and create an exercise branch from the
        networkx-2.6.3 tag/release:
        ```console
        $ cd networkx
        $ git switch --create exercise networkx-2.6.3
        ```
        On old Git versions which do not know the `switch` command (before 2.23), you
        need to use this instead:
        ```console
        $ git checkout -b exercise networkx-2.6.3
        ```
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} GitHub
        We can visit the version directly: <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/tree/networkx-2.6.3>
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} VS Code
        Switch to "Source Control", then the "..." menu, then "Branch", then "Create new branch from..." and select "networkx-2.6.3".
      ::::

      ::::{group-tab} RStudio
      Use the command line method (but you don't need to `cd networkx`, the RStudio terminal starts in the right place.)  So, run this:
      ```console
      $ git switch --create exercise networkx-2.6.3
      ```
      (and if it doesn't work, check Command Line for the command for older git)
      ::::

    :::::

  Then using the above toolbox try to:
  1. Find the code line which contains `"Logic error in degree_correlation"`.
  1. Find out when this line was last modified or added. Find the actual commit which modified that line.
  1. Inspect the commit. What is the commit change? What is the commit metadata?
  1. Create a branch pointing to the past when that commit was created to be
     able to browse and use the code as it was back then.
  1. How would you bring the code to the version of the code right before that line was last modified?

  ::::::{solution}

    :::::{tabs}
      ::::{group-tab} Command line
        1. We use `git grep`:
           ```console
           $ git grep "Logic error in degree_correlation"
           ```
           This gives the output:
           ```
           networkx/algorithms/threshold.py:                print("Logic error in degree_correlation", i, rdi)
           ```
           Maybe you also want to know the line number:
           ```console
           $ git grep -n "Logic error in degree_correlation"
           ```
        2. We use `git annotate`:
           ```console
           $ git annotate networkx/algorithms/threshold.py
           ```
           Then search for "Logic error" by typing "/Logic error" followed by Enter.
           The last commit that modified it was `90544b4fa` (unless that line changed since).
        3. We use `git show`:
           ```console
           $ git show 90544b4fa
           ```
        4. Create a branch pointing to that commit (here we called the branch "past-code"):
           ```console
           $ git branch past-code 90544b4fa
           ```
        5. This is a compact way to access the first parent of `90544b4fa` (here we
           called the branch "just-before"):
           ```console
           $ git switch --create just-before 90544b4fa~1
           ```
      ::::
  
      ::::{group-tab} GitHub
        1. On top of <https://github.com/networkx/networkx> click on the
           magnifying glass and search for "Logic error in degree_correlation".
           This tells us that the file `networkx/algorithms/threshold.py`
           contains this line and you can click on the file.
           This brings you to <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/409979eff35f02eff54f4eea3731736bd431dc2e/networkx/algorithms/threshold.py#L550>.
        2. Click on the "Blame" button. Left next to the highlighted line you see
           the commit which modified it last.
        3. You can click on the commit (open in new browser tab) which brings you
           to <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/commit/90544b4fa5a7397a86e69ebf5778f4a0f6eafe1e>.
        4. Let's skip creating the branch on GitHub. Instead, we can browse the
           project at this version:
           <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/tree/90544b4>.
        5. Go back to the "Blame" view for the file `networkx/algorithms/threshold.py`:
           <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blame/409979eff35f02eff54f4eea3731736bd431dc2e/networkx/algorithms/threshold.py#L550>.
           Navigate to the symbol "Blame prior to change ..." which you find next to the commit message that modified this line.

## Finding out when something broke/changed with `git bisect`

This section only works with the command line.

*"But I am sure it used to work! Strange."* - Sometimes you realize that
something broke.  You know that it used to work.  You do not know **when precisely** it
broke.

:::{discussion} How would you solve this?
Before we go on first discuss how you would solve this problem: You know that it worked
500 commits ago but it does not work now.

- How would you find the commit which changed it?
- Why could it be useful to know the commit that changed it?
:::

We will probably arrive at a solution which is similar to `git bisect`:

- First find out a commit in past when it worked.
  ```console
  $ git bisect start
  $ git bisect good f0ea950  # this is a commit that worked
  $ git bisect bad main      # last commit is broken
  ```
- Now compile and/or run and/or test and decide whether "good" or "bad".
- This is how you can tell Git that this was a working commit:
  ```console
  $ git bisect good
  ```
- And this is how you can tell Git that this was not a working commit:
  ```console
  $ git bisect bad
  ```
- Then bisect/iterate your way until you find the commit that broke it.
- If you want to go back to start, type `git bisect reset`.
- This can even be automatized with `git bisect run SCRIPT`.
  For this you write a script that returns zero/non-zero (success/failure).


(exercise-bisect)=

## Optional exercise: Git bisect

This only works with the command line.

::::{exercise} (optional) Use git bisect to find the bad commit
  In this exercise, we use `git bisect` on an example repository.  It
  is OK if you do not complete this exercise fully.

  Begin by cloning [https://github.com/coderefinery/git-bisect-exercise](https://github.com/coderefinery/git-bisect-exercise).


  **Motivation**

  The motivation for this exercise is to be able to do archaeology with Git on a
  source code where the bug is difficult to see visually. **Finding the offending
  commit is often more than half the debugging**.


  **Background**

  The script `get_pi.py` approximates pi using terms of the Nilakantha series. It
  should produce 3.14 but it does not. The script broke at some point and
  produces 3.57 using the last commit:

  ```console
  $ python get_pi.py

  3.57
  ```

  At some point within the 500 first commits, an error was introduced. The only
  thing we know is that the first commit worked correctly.


  **Your task**

  - Clone this repository and use `git bisect` to find the commit which
    broke the computation
    ([solution - spoiler alert!](https://github.com/coderefinery/git-bisect-exercise#solutions-spoiler-alert)).
  - Once you have found the offending commit, also practice navigating to the last good commit.
  - Bonus exercise:
    Write a script that checks for a correct result and use `git bisect run` to
    find the offending commit automatically
    ([solution - spoiler alert!](https://github.com/coderefinery/git-bisect-exercise#solutions-spoiler-alert)).


  **Hints**

  Finding the first commit:

  ```console
  $ git log --oneline | tail -n 1
  ```

  How to navigate to the parent of a commit with hash SOMEHASH:
  ```console
  $ git switch --create BRANCHNAME SOMEHASH~1
  ```

  Instead of a tilde you can also use this:
  ```console
  $ git switch --create BRANCHNAME SOMEHASH^
  ```
::::


## Summary

- git log/grep/annotate/show/bisect is a powerful combination when doing archaeology in a project on the command line.
- `git switch --create NAME HASH` is the recommended mechanism to inspect old code on the command line.
- Most of these commands can be used in the GitHub web interface (except `git bisect`).
