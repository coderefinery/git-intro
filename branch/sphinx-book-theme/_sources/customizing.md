# Customizing Git

## Shell prompt

```{instructor-note}
Here the instructor can demonstrate how a context-aware and Git-aware shell
prompt can look like.
```

You can make your shell display contextual information about
your Git state even at all times.

Here are few example projects that make this possible and easy:
- <https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt> (bash)
- <https://ohmyz.sh/> (zsh)
- <https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish> (fish)
- <https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt> (bash and fish)

## More useful "diff" output

[Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) is a syntax-highlighting pager for
git, diff, and grep output.  You can customize how you want to highlight the
"diff" output.  It allows side-by-side view, word-level diff highlighting,
improved merge conflict display, and much more.
