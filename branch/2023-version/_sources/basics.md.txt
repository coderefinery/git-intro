## What is Git, and what is a Git repository?

- Git is a version control system: can **record/save snapshots** and track the content of a folder as it changes over time.
- Every time we **commit** a snapshot, Git records a snapshot of the **entire project**, saves it, and assigns it a version.
- These snapshots are kept inside a sub-folder called `.git`.
- If we remove `.git`, we remove the repository and history (but keep the working directory!).
- The directory `.git` uses relative paths - you can move the whole repository somewhere else and it will still work.
- Git doesn't do anything unless you ask it to (it **does not record anything automatically**).
- Multiple interfaces to Git exist (command line, graphical interfaces, web interfaces).


## Recording a snapshot with Git

- Git takes snapshots only if we request it.
- We will record changes in two steps (we will later explain why this is a recommended practice).
- Example (we don't need to type yet):

  ```console
  $ git add FILE.txt
  $ git commit

  $ git add FILE.txt ANOTHERFILE.txt
  $ git commit
  ```

- We first focus (`git add`, we "stage" the change), then record (`git commit`):

```{figure} img/git_stage_commit.svg
:alt: Git staging
:width: 100%

Git staging and committing.
```

```{discussion} Question for the more advanced participants
What do you think will be the outcome if you
stage a file and then edit it and stage it again, do this several times and
at the end perform a commit? Think of focusing several scenes and pressing the
shutter at the end.
```


## Configuring Git command line

Before we start using Git on the command line, we need to configure Git.
This is also part of the
[installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/shell-and-git/#configuration)
but we need to make sure we all have
set name, email address, editor, and
default branch:
```console
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email yourname@example.com
$ git config --global core.editor nano
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Verify with:
```console
$ git config --list
```

```{instructor-note}
Instructors, give learners enough time to do the above configuration steps.
```


## Type-along: Tracking a guacamole recipe with Git

We will learn how to initialize a Git repository, how to track changes, and how
to make delicious guacamole! (Inspiration for this example based on a
suggestion by B. Smith in a discussion in the Carpentries mailing list)

The motivation for taking a cooking recipe instead of a program is that everybody can relate to cooking
but not everybody may be able to relate to a program written in e.g. Python or another specific language.

```{instructor-note}
Instructors, please encourage now that participants type along.
```

```{note}
It is possible to go through this lesson in the command line or in the browser
(on GitHub).

- We recommend to start with the command line but later to also try in the browser.
- If you get really stuck in the command line, try following in the browser and
  later you can try to return to the command line.
```


## Creating a repository

One of the basic principles of Git is that it is **easy to create repositories**:

`````{tabs}
  ````{group-tab} Command line
    ```console
    $ mkdir recipe
    $ cd recipe
    $ git init -b main
    ```

    That's it! With `git init -b main` have now created an empty Git repository
    where `main` is the default branch (more about branches later).

    We will use `git status` a lot to check out what is going on:

    ```console
    $ git status

    On branch main

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    ```

    We will make sense of this information during this workshop.
  ````

  ````{group-tab} Browser (GitHub)
    First log into GitHub, then follow the screenshots and descriptions below.

    ```{figure} img/basics/new-repo-plus.png
       :alt: Screenshot on GitHub before a new repository form is opened
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Click on the "plus" symbol on top right, then on "New repository".
    ```

    Another way to create a new repository is to visit
    <https://github.com/new> directly.

    ```{figure} img/basics/new-repo-form.png
       :alt: Screenshot on GitHub just before creating a new repository
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Choose a repository name, add a short description, **check "Add a
       README file"**, finally "Create repository".
    ```

    After you have clicked "Create repository" you should see a repository overview
    with one file (README.md) and one commit.
  ````
`````


## Adding files and committing changes

Let us now **create two files**.

One file is called `ingredients.txt` and contains:
```shell
* 2 avocados
* 1 chili
* 1 lime
* 2 tsp salt
```

The second file is called `instructions.txt` and contains:
```shell
* chop avocados
* chop onion
* chop chili
* squeeze lime
* add salt
* and mix well
```

`````{tabs}
  ````{group-tab} Command line
    As mentioned above, in Git you can always check the status of files in your repository using
    `git status`. It is always a safe command to run and in general a good idea to
    do when you are trying to figure out what to do next:

    ```console
    $ git status

    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ingredients.txt
        instructions.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```

    The two files are untracked in the repository (directory). You want to **add the files** (focus the camera)
    to the list of files tracked by Git. Git does not track
    any files automatically and you need make a conscious decision to add a file. Let's do what
    Git hints at, and add the files, one by one:

    ```console
    $ git add ingredients.txt
    $ git status

    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   ingredients.txt

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        instructions.txt
    ```

    Now this change is *staged* and ready to be committed.
    Let us now commit the change to the repository:
    ```console
    $ git commit -m "adding ingredients"

    [main (root-commit) f146d25] adding ingredients
     1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 ingredients.txt
    ```

    Right after we query the status to get this useful command into our muscle memory:
    ```console
    $ git status
    ```

    Now stage and commit also the other file:
    ```console
    $ git add instructions.txt
    $ git commit -m "adding instructions"
    ```

    We will add a third file to the repository, `README.md`, containing:
    ```markdown
    # recipe

    This is an exercise repository.
    ```

    Now stage and commit also the `README.md` file:
    ```console
    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit -m "adding README"
    ```

    What does the `-m` flag mean? Let us check the help page for that command:
    ```console
    $ git help commit
    ```

    You should see a very long help page as the tool is very versatile (press q to quit).
    Do not worry about this now but keep in mind that you can always read the help files
    when in doubt. Searching online can also be useful, but choosing search terms
    to find relevant information takes some practice and discussions in some
    online threads may be confusing.
    Note that help pages also work when you don't have a network connection!
  ````

  ````{group-tab} Browser (GitHub)
    ```{figure} img/basics/add-file.png
       :alt: Screenshot on GitHub before a new file is created
       :width: 100%
       :class: with-border

       Click on "Add file", then "Create new file".
    ```

    ```{figure} img/basics/edit-file.png
       :alt: Screenshot on GitHub when editing a file

       Before you commit the change, adjust the commit message.
    ```

    After you have added `ingredients.txt`, add also `instructions.txt` in a similar
    way.

    We have added two files, each in one commit. However, we ended up with
    three files and three commits since `README.md` was automatically committed
    when we created the repository on GitHub.

(exercise-record-changes)=

## Exercise: Record changes

``````{exercise} Basic-1: Record changes
  Add 1/2 onion to `ingredients.txt` and also the instruction

  `````{tabs}
    ````{group-tab} Command line
      After modifying the files, do not stage the changes yet (do not `git add`
      yet).

      When you are done editing the files, try `git diff`:
      ```console
      $ git diff
      ```

      You will see (can you identify in there the two added lines?):
      ```diff
      diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
      index 4422a31..ba8854f 100644

      ```

      Now first stage and commit each change separately (what happens when we leave out the `-m` flag?):
      ```console
      $ git add ingredients.txt
      $ git commit -m "add half an onion"
      $ git add instructions.txt
      $ git commit                   # <-- we have left out -m "..."
      ```

      When you leave out the `-m` flag, Git should open an editor where you can edit
      your commit message. This message will be associated and stored with the
      changes you made. This message is your chance to explain what you've done and
      convince others (and your future self) that the changes you made were
      justified.  Write a message and save and close the file.

      When you are done committing the changes, experiment with these commands:
      ```console
      $ git log
      $ git log --stat
      $ git log --oneline
      ```
    ````

    ````{group-tab} Browser (GitHub)
      We can make modifications to a file by clicking on the file and then the
      pen symbol:
      ```{figure} img/basics/pen-symbol.png
         :alt: Screenshot on GitHub before clicking on the pen symbol
         :width: 100%

         By clicking on the pen symbol we can switch to edit mode.
      ```

         Before committing the change, click on "Preview".
      ```

      Our goal is to arrive at two new commits:
      - "add half an onion" (modifying `ingredients.txt`)
      - "don't forget to enjoy" (modifying `instructions.txt`)

      When you are done committing the changes, try to browse commit history
      on GitHub.

    On GitHub you can also compare arbitrary two commits (replace "USER",

    `https://github.com/USER/recipe/compare/HASH1..HASH2`

    Try it with two of your commits.
  ````
`````

- We can browse the development and access each state that we have committed.
- The long hashes uniquely label a state of the code.
- They are not just integers counting 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (why?).
- Output is in reverse chronological order, i.e. **newest commits on top**.
- We will use them when comparing versions and when going back in time.
- `git log --oneline` only shows the first 7 characters of the commit hash and is good to get an overview.
- If the first characters of the hash are unique it is not necessary to type the entire hash.
- `git log --stat` is nice to show which files have been modified.

````{exercise} (optional) Basic-3: Visual diff tools
  This exercise is only relevant for the command line. In the browser,
  the preview is already side-by-side and "visual".

  - Make further modifications and experiment with `git difftool` (requires installing one of the [visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)):

  On Windows or Linux:
  ```console
  $ git difftool --tool=meld HASH
  ```

  On macOS:
  ```console
  $ git difftool --tool=opendiff HASH
  ```

  ```{figure} img/meld.png

  You probably want to use the same visual diff tool every time and
  you can configure Git for that:
  ```console
  $ git config --global diff.tool meld
  ```
````

```{exercise} (optional) Basic-4: Browser and command line
You have noticed that it is possible to work either in the command
line or in the browser. It could help to deepen the understanding
trying to do the above steps in both.

- If you have managed to do the above in the command line, try now in the browser.
- If you got stuck in the command line and move to the browser, try now to trouble-shoot the command line Git.
```


## Writing useful commit messages

Using `git log --oneline` or browsing a repository on the web, we better
understand that the first line of the commit message is very important.

Good example:
```text
increase threshold alpha to 2.0

the motivation for this change is
to enable ...
...
this is based on a discussion in #123
```

Convention: **one line summarizing the commit, then one empty line,
then paragraph(s) with more details in free form, if necessary**.

- **Why something was changed is more important than what has changed.**
- Cross-reference to issues and discussions if possible/relevant.
- Bad commit messages: "fix", "oops", "save work"
- Bad examples: [http://whatthecommit.com](http://whatthecommit.com)
- Write commit messages in English that will be understood
  15 years from now by someone else than you. Or by your future you.
- Many projects start out as projects "just for me" and end up to be successful projects
  that are developed by 50 people over decades.
- [Commits with multiple authors](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/) are possible.

Good references:

- ["My favourite Git commit"](https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit)
- ["On commit messages"](https://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)
- ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

```{note}
A great way to learn how to write commit messages and to get inspired by their
style choices: **browse repositories of codes that you use/like**:

Some examples (but there are so many good examples):
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commits/main)
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commits/main)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/main)
- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits/master)
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/commits/main),
  compare with their [release
  notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/releases)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/commits/main),
  compare with their [release
  notes](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/main/CHANGES.rst)

When designing commit message styles consider also these:
- How will you easily generate a changelog or release notes?
- During code review, you can help each other improving commit messages.
```

But remember: it is better to make any commit, than no commit. Especially in small projects.
**Let not the perfect be the enemy of the good enough**.


(gitignore)=

## Ignoring files and paths with .gitignore

```{discussion}
- Should we add and track all files in a project?
- How about generated files?
- Why is it considered a bad idea to commit compiled binaries to version control?
- What types of generated files do you know?
```

Compiled and generated files are not
committed to version control. There are many reasons for this:

- These files can make it more difficult to run on different platforms.
- These files are automatically generated and thus do not contribute in any meaningful way.
- When tracking generated files you could see differences in the code although you haven't touched the code.

For this we use `.gitignore` files. Example:
```shell
# ignore compiled python 2 files
*.pyc
# ignore compiled python 3 files
__pycache__
```

An example taken from the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore):
```shell
# ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.
*.[oa]
# ignore generated html files,
*.html
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand
!foo.html
# ignore everything under build directory
build/
```

- `.gitignore` should be part of the repository because we want to make sure that all developers see the same behavior.
- **All files should be either tracked or ignored**.
- `.gitignore` uses something called a
  [shell glob syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for
  determining file patterns to ignore. You can read more about the syntax in the
  [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
- You can have `.gitignore` files in lower level directories and they affect the paths below.


## Graphical user interfaces

We have seen how to make commits in the command line and via the GitHub website.
But it is also possible to work from within a Git graphical user interface (GUI):

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
- [List of third-party GUIs](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)


## Summary

Now we know how to save snapshots:

```console
$ git add FILE(S)
$ git commit
```

And this is what we do as we program.

Every state is then saved and later we will learn how to go back to these "checkpoints"
and how to undo things.

```console
$ git init -b main  # initialize new repository (main is default branch)
$ git add           # add files or stage file(s)
$ git commit        # commit staged file(s)
$ git status        # see what is going on
$ git log           # see history
$ git diff          # show unstaged/uncommitted modifications
$ git show          # show the change for a specific commit
$ git mv            # move/rename tracked files
$ git rm            # remove tracked files
```

Git is not ideal for large binary files
(for this consider [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com)).

````{challenge} Basic-5: Test your understanding
  Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
  to an existing local Git repository?

  1. ```console
     $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
     ```
  2. ```console
     $ git init myfile.txt
     $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
     ```
  3. ```console
     $ git add myfile.txt
     $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
     ```
  4. ```console
     $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
     ```
  ```{solution}

  1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
  2. Would try to create a new repository in a folder "myfile.txt".
  3. **Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.**
  4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.
  ```
````

```{keypoints}
- It takes only one command to initialize a Git repository: `git init -b main`.
- Commits should be used to tell a story.
- Git uses the .git folder to store the snapshots.
- Don't be afraid to stage and commit often. Better too often than not often enough.
```
